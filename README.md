<b>[Tinder-liker-for-console]</b>
This code its origin is from https://github.com/tonylintonylin/Tinder-auto-right-swipe.git.
Since the code was still usabele with a simple edit but the master achieved the code so would love to have a working updated one online and will also put some time in this project to support all different languages.

This version of Tinder-liker-for-console is for now only working if your language of the website is put as En/en -> English.
if you want it for now to work on your own standard language, you can just simply change the "Fun" value 

<b>[Easy to use, easy to remove and everyone happy]</b>

This small code has to be added into your browser console.
After putting the code in the console and hitting enter will open a window to verify turning it on.
When verified turning it on, the code will do its work!

After the code is doing its work --> * Unlimited liking all people to the right till it runs out litarly of profiles or you stop the code (* = Or you have a maximum amount everday only because no use of premium from tinder.)
Do know to keep open your console and also the matching page of tinder.com.

You can stop the script for runnig by pause it with key input (Chrome): Ctrl + \". 
Or just refresh the Tinder.com page and the script has been cleared and will not be active anymore.

<b>[Script not working]</b>

The feature that tinder added is that for every laungage the "Fun" valuea will be written in the spoken language of destination or by setting by.
This updated version will be updated to provide all written languages so no one would have any problem to run this script.
